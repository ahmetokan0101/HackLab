                    "content": "Ethical hacking is a comprehensive set of legal and controlled penetration tests conducted to identify security vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or applications and prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited by malicious individuals.\r\n\r\nThe primary responsibility of an ethical hacker is to think like an attacker to protect organizations' digital assets, analyze the methods used by attackers, and apply the same techniques for defensive purposes. This allows system weaknesses to be revealed, and security levels to be improved by taking necessary measures.\r\n\r\nEthical hacking activities are carried out entirely:\r\n\r\n✔ With legal authorization,\r\n\r\n✔ Within defined scope,\r\n\r\n✔ By adhering to specific rules,\r\n\r\n✔ Through a professional reporting process\r\n\r\nThis process enables organizations to become more resilient against cyber threats and allows security vulnerabilities to be detected before they are discovered by malicious attackers.\r\n\r\n💡 Real-World Example:\r\nAn e-commerce site requests ethical hackers to test their website. Ethical hackers find security vulnerabilities, report them, and the site closes these vulnerabilities. Result: Customer data is protected and the site becomes more secure. This ensures that thousands of users' personal information and credit card data remain safe.",

                    "content": "The primary purpose of ethical hacking is to discover security vulnerabilities in organizations' information systems before attackers do and to develop solutions that will prevent these vulnerabilities from being exploited. This approach is one of the most critical components of modern cybersecurity strategies.\r\n\r\nThanks to an ethical hacker's work, systems experience:\r\n\r\n🔹 Early-stage detection of weak points\r\n\r\nSystem architecture, software components, and network structure are analyzed in depth to reveal hidden security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nExample: In 2023, a bank prevented credit card information theft thanks to ethical hackers. The vulnerability was detected and closed, thus protecting thousands of customers' financial data.\r\n\r\n🔹 Risk assessment of potential vulnerabilities\r\n\r\nThreats that could occur if these vulnerabilities are exploited, such as data loss, privilege escalation, and service outages, are examined from an expert perspective.\r\n\r\nExample: A SQL Injection vulnerability found on an e-commerce site was detected by an ethical hacker. Risk analysis determined that this vulnerability could provide access to the entire customer database, and immediate action was taken.\r\n\r\n🔹 Development of practical solutions\r\n\r\nFor each identified vulnerability, technical improvements, configuration adjustments, or security policies are created.\r\n\r\nExample: For the weak password issue detected in the admin panel, the ethical hacker recommended two-factor authentication (2FA) and strong password policies. These recommendations were implemented, and the security level increased by 300%.\r\n\r\n🔹 Enhancement of the organization's security level\r\n\r\nAfter vulnerabilities are closed, the system becomes more resilient, and attackers' chances of success are significantly reduced.\r\n\r\nExample: A technology company closed 15 critical vulnerabilities after ethical hacking tests. As a result, resistance to cyber attacks increased by 85%, and the company was protected from millions of dollars in potential damage.\r\n\r\nIn short, ethical hacking puts organizations one step ahead against cyber threats by using attack techniques for defensive purposes."

All work must be conducted within the framework of official authorization.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n• Obtaining a written \"penetration test authorization document\" from the company\r\n• Clearly defining the systems to be tested (website, API, company network, etc.)\r\n\r\n2. Reconnaissance (1-3 days)\r\n\r\nPassive and active reconnaissance is performed on the target system. This information forms the basis for vulnerability analysis.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n• Learning domain owner information through WHOIS query\r\n• Using Nmap to detect if ports such as 80, 443, 21, or 22 are open on the server\r\n\r\n3. Analysis (2-5 days)\r\n\r\nBased on the collected information, potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified. Software versions, open ports, and known vulnerabilities are analyzed.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n• Testing for CVE-2021-41773 vulnerability if Apache 2.4.49 version is detected\r\n• Identifying systems operating with default passwords\r\n\r\n4. Testing (3-7 days)\r\n\r\nFound vulnerabilities are exploited in a controlled manner. The goal is to verify whether the vulnerabilities are actually exploitable.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n• Accessing user information in the database through SQL Injection\r\n• Compromising the admin panel through brute-force attack\r\n• Opening a reverse shell to execute commands on the server\r\n\r\n5. Reporting (1 week)\r\n\r\nAll identified vulnerabilities are documented in a professional report. Solution recommendations are provided for each vulnerability, and risk levels are determined.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n• Admin panel is vulnerable to brute-force attacks; 2FA should be added.\r\n• SQL Injection vulnerability exists; parameterized queries should be used.",

They earn rewards by finding and reporting vulnerabilities in systems and protect Google. In 2023, Google distributed $12 million in rewards to ethical hackers.\r\n\r\n🔹 Black Hat Hacker\r\nThese are individuals who gain unauthorized access to systems through illegal methods, steal data, or cause damage.\r\nTheir goals are usually profit, causing harm, stealing credentials, data leakage, or making money.\r\nThis group constitutes the most dangerous side of cyber threats.\r\n\r\nExample: The hackers who carried out the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017. It affected over 300,000 computers and demanded millions of dollars in ransom. Such attacks fall under cybercrime.\r\n\r\n🔹 Grey Hat Hacker\r\nThese are hackers who may engage in both ethical and unethical behaviors.\r\nThey are not always malicious; however, entering systems without authorization places them in a legally risky position.\r\nSome discover vulnerabilities and report them to the company; others may use them for their own benefit.\r\n\r\nExample: A security researcher finds a vulnerability on a company's website but tests it without authorization. Then they report the vulnerability to the company and ensure it is fixed. However, they are legally at risk because they made unauthorized access.\r\n\r\n👉 Key Distinction Point\r\n\r\nThe most critical difference that distinguishes these three types of hackers from each other:\r\nWhether their actions are legal, whether they adhere to ethical rules, and what their intentions are.\r\n\r\nWhite hats protect, black hats attack, and grey hats operate in the grey area in between.",

Password security tests are critical for enhancing system security.\r\n\r\n🔹 Password Testing Tools:\r\n\r\n• John the Ripper: Cracking hashed passwords\r\n• Hashcat: GPU-accelerated password cracking\r\n• Hydra: Online password attempts (brute-force)\r\n• Medusa: Multi-protocol password attempts\r\n\r\n🔹 Testing Methods:\r\n\r\n• Dictionary Attack: Using common password lists\r\n• Brute-Force Attack: Trying all possible combinations\r\n• Hybrid Attack: Dictionary + brute-force combination\r\n• Rainbow Table: Pre-computed hashes\r\n\r\n💡 Real-World Example:\r\n\r\nAn ethical hacker tested hashed passwords on a system using John the Ripper:\r\n\r\n• \"password123\" - cracked in 2 minutes\r\n• \"admin\" - cracked in 30 seconds\r\n• \"123456\" - cracked in 10 seconds\r\n• \"P@ssw0rd!\" - cracked in 5 hours\r\n• \"Tr0ub4dor&3\" - not cracked (strong password)\r\n\r\nThis test showed the danger of weak password policies. The company implemented strong password policies and made 2FA mandatory.\r\n\r\n🔹 Strong Password Criteria:\r\n\r\n• At least 12 characters\r\n• Uppercase and lowercase letters\r\n• Numbers and special characters\r\n• Not using dictionary words\r\n• Not using personal information\r\n\r\n💡 Tip:\r\nStrong password = strong defense. This step is critical for user security. Users should use strong passwords and enable 2FA.\r\n\r\n✅ Conclusion:\r\nPassword security tests detect the weakest points in systems. These tests help implement strong password policies and increase user awareness.",
